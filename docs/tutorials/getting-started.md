## Meet RMB_AID-Help: Your Intelligent Guide

**RMB_AID-Help is the fastest way to get started with RMB_AID.** You don't need to memorize workflows or phases — just ask, and RMB_AID-Help will:

- **Inspect your project** to see what's already been done
- **Show your options** based on which modules you have installed
- **Recommend what's next** — including the first required task
- **Answer questions** like "I have a SaaS idea, where do I start?"

### How to Use RMB_AID-Help

Run it in your AI IDE by invoking the skill:

```
rmbaid-help
```

Or combine it with a question for context-aware guidance:

```
rmbaid-help I have an idea for a SaaS product, I already know all the features I want. where do I get started?
```

RMB_AID-Help will respond with:
- What's recommended for your situation
- What the first required task is
- What the rest of the process looks like

### It Powers Workflows Too

RMB_AID-Help doesn't just answer questions — **it automatically runs at the end of every workflow** to tell you exactly what to do next. No guessing, no searching docs — just clear guidance on the next required workflow.

:::tip[Start Here]
After installing RMB_AID, invoke the `rmbaid-help` skill immediately. It will detect what modules you have installed and guide you to the right starting point for your project.
:::

## Understanding RMB_AID

RMB_AID helps you build software through guided workflows with specialized AI agents. The process follows four phases:

| Phase | Name           | What Happens                                        |
| ----- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Analysis       | Brainstorming, research, product brief or PRFAQ *(optional)* |
| 2     | Planning       | Create requirements (PRD or spec)              |
| 3     | Solutioning    | Design architecture *(RMB_AID/Enterprise only)* |
| 4     | Implementation | Build epic by epic, story by story                  |

**[Open the Workflow Map](../reference/workflow-map.md)** to explore phases, workflows, and context management.

Based on your project's complexity, RMB_AID offers three planning tracks:

| Track           | Best For                                               | Documents Created                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Quick Flow**  | Bug fixes, simple features, clear scope (1-15 stories) | Tech-spec only                         |
| **RMB_AID** | Products, platforms, complex features (10-50+ stories) | PRD + Architecture + UX                |
| **Enterprise**  | Compliance, multi-tenant systems (30+ stories)         | PRD + Architecture + Security + DevOps |

:::note
Story counts are guidance, not definitions. Choose your track based on planning needs, not story math.
:::

## Installation

Open a terminal in your project directory and run:

```bash
npx rmb-aid install
```

If you want the newest prerelease build instead of the default release channel, use `npx rmb-aid@next install`.

When prompted to select modules, choose **RMB_AID**.

The installer creates two folders:
- `_rmbaid/` — agents, workflows, tasks, and configuration
- `_rmbaid-output/` — empty for now, but this is where your artifacts will be saved

:::tip[Your Next Step]
Open your AI IDE in the project folder and run:

```
rmbaid-help
```

RMB_AID-Help will detect what you've completed and recommend exactly what to do next. You can also ask it questions like "What are my options?" or "I have a SaaS idea, where should I start?"
:::

:::note[How to Load Agents and Run Workflows]
Each workflow has a **skill** you invoke by name in your IDE (e.g., `rmbaid-create-prd`). Your AI tool will recognize the `rmbaid-*` name and run it — you don't need to load agents separately. You can also invoke an agent skill directly for general conversation (e.g., `rmbaid-agent-pm` for the PM agent).
:::

:::caution[Fresh Chats]
Always start a fresh chat for each workflow. This prevents context limitations from causing issues.
:::

## Step 1: Create Your Plan

Work through phases 1-3. **Use fresh chats for each workflow.**

:::tip[Project Context (Optional)]
Before starting, consider creating `project-context.md` to document your technical preferences and implementation rules. This ensures all AI agents follow your conventions throughout the project.

Create it manually at `_rmbaid-output/project-context.md` or generate it after architecture using `rmbaid-generate-project-context`. [Learn more](../explanation/project-context.md).
:::

### Phase 1: Analysis (Optional)

All workflows in this phase are optional. [**Not sure which to use?**](../explanation/analysis-phase.md)
- **brainstorming** (`rmbaid-brainstorming`) — Guided ideation
- **research** (`rmbaid-market-research` / `rmbaid-domain-research` / `rmbaid-technical-research`) — Market, domain, and technical research
- **product-brief** (`rmbaid-product-brief`) — Recommended foundation document when your concept is clear
- **prfaq** (`rmbaid-prfaq`) — Working Backwards challenge to stress-test and forge your product concept

### Phase 2: Planning (Required)

**For RMB_AID and Enterprise tracks:**
1. Invoke the **PM agent** (`rmbaid-agent-pm`) in a new chat
2. Run the `rmbaid-create-prd` workflow (`rmbaid-create-prd`)
3. Output: `PRD.md`

**For Quick Flow track:**
- Run `rmbaid-quick-dev` — it handles planning and implementation in a single workflow, skip to implementation

:::note[UX Design (Optional)]
If your project has a user interface, invoke the **UX-Designer agent** (`rmbaid-agent-ux-designer`) and run the UX design workflow (`rmbaid-create-ux-design`) after creating your PRD.
:::

### Phase 3: Solutioning (RMB_AID/Enterprise)

**Create Architecture**
1. Invoke the **Architect agent** (`rmbaid-agent-architect`) in a new chat
2. Run `rmbaid-create-architecture` (`rmbaid-create-architecture`)
3. Output: Architecture document with technical decisions

**Create Epics and Stories**

:::tip[V6 Improvement]
Epics and stories are now created *after* architecture. This produces better quality stories because architecture decisions (database, API patterns, tech stack) directly affect how work should be broken down.
:::

1. Invoke the **PM agent** (`rmbaid-agent-pm`) in a new chat
2. Run `rmbaid-create-epics-and-stories` (`rmbaid-create-epics-and-stories`)
3. The workflow uses both PRD and Architecture to create technically-informed stories

**Implementation Readiness Check** *(Highly Recommended)*
1. Invoke the **Architect agent** (`rmbaid-agent-architect`) in a new chat
2. Run `rmbaid-check-implementation-readiness` (`rmbaid-check-implementation-readiness`)
3. Validates cohesion across all planning documents

## Step 2: Build Your Project

Once planning is complete, move to implementation. **Each workflow should run in a fresh chat.**

### Initialize Sprint Planning

Invoke the **Developer agent** (`rmbaid-agent-dev`) and run `rmbaid-sprint-planning` (`rmbaid-sprint-planning`). This creates `sprint-status.yaml` to track all epics and stories.

### The Build Cycle

For each story, repeat this cycle with fresh chats:

| Step | Agent | Workflow       | Command                    | Purpose                            |
| ---- | ----- | -------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1    | DEV   | `rmbaid-create-story` | `rmbaid-create-story`  | Create story file from epic        |
| 2    | DEV   | `rmbaid-dev-story`    | `rmbaid-dev-story`     | Implement the story                |
| 3    | DEV   | `rmbaid-code-review`  | `rmbaid-code-review`   | Quality validation *(recommended)* |

After completing all stories in an epic, invoke the **Developer agent** (`rmbaid-agent-dev`) and run `rmbaid-retrospective` (`rmbaid-retrospective`).

## Common Questions

**Do I always need architecture?**
Only for RMB_AID and Enterprise tracks. Quick Flow skips from spec to implementation.

**Can I change my plan later?**
Yes. The `rmbaid-correct-course` workflow handles scope changes mid-implementation.

**What if I want to brainstorm first?**
Invoke the Analyst agent (`rmbaid-agent-analyst`) and run `rmbaid-brainstorming` (`rmbaid-brainstorming`) before starting your PRD.

**Do I need to follow a strict order?**
Not strictly. Once you learn the flow, you can run workflows directly using the Quick Reference above.

## Getting Help

:::tip[First Stop: RMB_AID-Help]
**Invoke `rmbaid-help` anytime** — it's the fastest way to get unstuck. Ask it anything:
- "What should I do after installing?"
- "I'm stuck on workflow X"
- "What are my options for Y?"
- "Show me what's been done so far"

RMB_AID-Help inspects your project, detects what you've completed, and tells you exactly what to do next.
:::

- **During workflows** — Agents guide you with questions and explanations
- **Community** — [Discord](https://discord.gg/gk8jAdXWmj) (#rmb-aid-help, #report-bugs-and-issues)

## Key Takeaways

:::tip[Remember These]
- **Start with `rmbaid-help`** — Your intelligent guide that knows your project and options
- **Always use fresh chats** — Start a new chat for each workflow
- **Track matters** — Quick Flow uses `rmbaid-quick-dev`; Method/Enterprise need PRD and architecture
- **RMB_AID-Help runs automatically** — Every workflow ends with guidance on what's next
